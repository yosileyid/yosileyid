# Docs / Documentation

<!-- Change the name and information here to reflect your organization or repo and its values -->

This is just a simple way of holding templates to use for future repos. As I add generic docs I will update this README to make it easier to locate information. For now it has the following:

- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [LICENSE](#license)
- [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
- [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
- [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)


## Code Of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct template can be used as is, or just modify it and add whatever you need specific to your project. Ours can be found [here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We network and communicate on Discord so our CoC reflects that.

## [![License: MPL 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MPL_2.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0)

We use the Mozilla Public License v2.0 it covers all of the bases and can be modified to fit your project whatever your needs are. It isn't too long and can be found [here](LICENSE)
