Completing FreeCodeCamp's Algorithms and Data Structures Javascript course, I want to earn all the certificates on the FCC site. Then I am going to take take the MIT edX 6.00 Python course. After that I should have a solid understanding of using my two favorite languages python, and JavaScript. I went blind about 6 years ago and was unable to finish the courses. I am back now and working on them again. Feel free to reach out to me and help me or just to chat.

ANYTHING! If it is JavaScript, TypeScript, ECMAScript, or python, I would love to help and learn more about contributing.

I recently made a Chrome extension TODO app and successfully broke it! :D I feel like getting the icons to register correctly and the app to appear in the toolbar and show some elements was good enough for a newbie for now, so I will correct the Javascript to use the correct Chrome API method and get it back running. I had up a simple GitHub hosted webpage, but I am thinking about deleting it until I have something noteworthy to show on there? I have a blog on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/devdreams) if you would like to follow me on there.
