I like to write discord bots. I use Node.js and the Discord.js libraries to make simple game and document bots. You can read all about them in the links below. I am also focused on self improvement in coding. I love to organize and document. GitHub allows me an easy endpoint to be as OCD as I want to about my code. I am just setting up my account and it is a work in progress as we all are :-) I run a discord server for a small group of Jewish developers who met on discord and network on there. We decided on the name ["Hasidic Developer Group"](https://github.com/hasidicdevs) or "hdg" we welcome contributions from anyone who can read our org ["Docs"](https://github.com/hasidicdevs/Docs). Consider joining our [DIscord Server](https://discord.gg/KpGXAEnVnv) and joining our team.

## Collaboration

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **_anything_** JavaScript / Node.Js, TypeScript / Deno, ECMAScript, or python, I would love to help and contribute more on here. Here are the places I am most active online where you can interact with me. If you need to use email, it is listed on the side under my profile picture.

## Top-Repos

### `hasidicdevs/hdg-bot`
This started out as a simple tutorial on how to build a bot for discord that only has three files and takes seconds to setup. It is now a NPM package you can install by `npm install hdg-bot` this is the bot base I use to create other bots that need access to the features built into hdg-bot so I don't need to code them over and over again. You can find the package on [NPM here](https://npmjs.com/package/hdg-bot) and get support in our server listed below.

### `yosileyid/dsb/`
"Document Support Bot" written using "hdg-bot" to implement the bot package. It is a work in progress to mainly be used for referencing docs on sefaria.org and github.com and reference documents from `hdg/Docs` I have plans to expand it to play small games and implement a leveling system.

### `CodeFolio/`

This is my online code portfolio. It has links to some of the other repos I use for project building and code solving for fun. This started off as my repo to hold @FreeCodeCamp certifications and projects needed for their courses, but as I added on more projects and sites it grew too difficult to manage and I had to split it into more. The linked repos are listed below.

- `fcc/`: FreeCodeCamp projects
- `nsc/`: Nodeschool projects
- `mpl/`: Mega Project List
