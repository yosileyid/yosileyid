## `whoami`

I am focused on self improvement in coding. I love to organize and document. GitHub allows me an easy endpoint to be as OCD as I want to about my code. I am just setting up my account and it is a work in progress. I run a discord server for a small group of Jewish developers who met on discord and decided to form a web development company. We decided on the name ["Hasidic Developer Group"](https://github.com/hasidicdevs) or "hdg" we welcome contributions from anyone who can read our org ["Docs"](https://github.com/hasidicdevs/hdg-docs). Consider joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KpGXAEnVnv) and joining our team.

## `top-repos`

### `yosileyid/jekyll-newspaper`

This is a Jekyll blog theme I created to look like the layout of a Newspaper site. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/yosileyid/jekyll-newspaper) and the Gem to install it is [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-newspaper) if you feel like contributing please join the Discord server and let's discuss it.

### `CodeFolio/`

This is my online code portfolio. It has links to some of the other repos I use for project building and code solving for fun. This started off as my repo to hold @FreeCodeCamp certifications and projects needed for their courses, but as I added on more projects and sites it grew too difficult to manage and I had to split it into more. The linked repos are listed below.

- `fcc/` - FreeCodeCamp projects
- `nsc/` - Nodeschool projects
- `mpl/` - Mega Project List
