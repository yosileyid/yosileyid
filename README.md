# Welcome to My Profile

## Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

**Anything** JavaScript / Node.Js, TypeScript / Deno, ECMAScript, or python, I would love to help and contribute more on here. You can get in touch with me via email or in issues in GitHub.I enjoy working with JavaScript and python frameworks and creating apps and extensions for browsers like @mozilla-firefox and @ChromeOs using @reactjs and @nodejs. I have a background in Network Administration and Security (BS) and spent years in InfoSec and Linux Systems Administration. I am more comfortable on the backend, but I am learning more frontend via free code courses online in my spare time. I am currently working on adding more repos of local development I have done, I work construction and code at night. I want to transition into freelance work. If you have a project you need extra hands on feel free to reach out. I recently published my first package to `npm`. You can see the work being done to it in [@yosileyid/hdg-bot](https://github.com/yosileyid/hdg-bot), and [@yosileyid/Document Support Bot](https://github.com/yosileyid/Document-Support-Bot)
