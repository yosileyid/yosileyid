## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

ANYTHING JavaScript, TypeScript/Deno, ECMAScript, or python, I would love to help and contribute more on here. You can get in touch with me via email or Discord if you have that. I prefer it for communication. I even have a cool little bot I made for it, and my own little development server where I learn about interesting features such as ```webhooks``` and ```developer portals``` etc. 

## :construction_worker: What I'm Working On

I am currently working on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I really like the User Interface and the way they teach the material. I am keeping the certificates in [Projects/fcc/Certificates](https://github.com/hasidicdev/hasidicdev.github.io/tree/main/projects/fcc/Certificates) and am working on getting all of their certificates. I recently completed the "Responsive Web Design" certification. I am working on the projects needed to complete the "Data Structures &amp; Algorithms" section. I am keeping a blog over on Patreon to write about my experiences along the way and what I am doing.
