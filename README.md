## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

ANYTHING JavaScript, TypeScript/Deno, ECMAScript, or python, I would love to help and contribute more on here. You can get in touch with me via email or Discord if you have that. I prefer it for communication. I even have a cool little bot I made for it, and my own little development server where I learn about interesting features such as ```webhooks``` and ```developer portals``` etc.
