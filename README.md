## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

ANYTHING JavaScript, TypeScript/Deno, ECMAScript, or python, I would love to help and contribute more on here. You can get in touch with me via email or Discord if you have that. I prefer it for communication. I even have a little bot I made for it, and my own little development server where I learn about interesting features using the Discord API such as ```webhooks``` and ```developer portals``` etc. 

## :construction_worker: What I'm Working On

I am currently working on adding more repos of local development I have done, I work construction and code at night. I want to transition into freelance work. If you have a project you need extra hands on feel free to reach out. I am building a discord bot to assist some functions in my server and run little games and prizes. I am working on my portfolio, and this github account.
